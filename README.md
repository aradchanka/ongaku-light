A modern, lightweight music player web application built with React. Ongaku Light allows users to navigate a music library, explore artists and albums, and view details for individual tracks. **Note**: Currently, the application uses a mock server for data and simulated interactions; actual music playback functionality is limited to mock data.

## Features

- **Music Library Navigation**: Browse and discover music through intuitive "Explore" and "Library" sections
- **Artist Browsing**: View detailed artist profiles including biographies and top tracks
- **Album Exploration**: Browse albums by artist with cover art and release information
- **Track Details**: Access detailed information about individual tracks
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized layout for various screen sizes using Tailwind CSS
- **Mock Server Integration**: Simulated backend for development and testing

## Tech Stack

- **React** - A JavaScript library for building user interfaces
- **React Router** - Declarative routing for React applications
- **TypeScript** - JavaScript with syntax for types to enhance development experience
- **Vite** - Next generation frontend tooling for faster development
- **Tailwind CSS** - A utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development
- **Node.js** - JavaScript runtime for server-side applications
- **Docker** - Containerization for consistent development and deployment environments

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (version 18 or higher recommended)
- npm (comes with Node.js) or yarn
- Git for version control

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/aradchanka/ongaku-light.git
   cd ongaku-light
   ```

2. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### Running the Application

#### Development Mode

Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will launch the application in development mode, typically accessible at `http://localhost:3000` (the exact URL will be displayed in your console).

#### Mock Server

To use the mock server for data (required for development):

```bash
npm run mock-server
```

This starts a simple HTTP server on port 8080 that serves mock data from the `mock-server/public` directory.

For full functionality, run both the development server and mock server concurrently (using separate terminal windows).

#### Building for Production

To create an optimized production build:

```bash
npm run build
```

#### Running in Production Mode

After building, serve the production files:

```bash
npm run start
```

This command will start a server to serve the optimized, static assets.

## Typechecking

This project uses TypeScript for static typing. To check for type errors:

```bash
npm run typecheck
```

This command will generate React Router types and then run the TypeScript compiler to verify type correctness across the project.
